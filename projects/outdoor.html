       <h3>Enjoying the view</h3>
       <p>I've always wondered how to make photos better in a way it could make it prettier or change the look of it</p>
       <p>Well.. I can now! I have all of the Adobe Programs, and with them there are no limitations on editing images</p>
       <p>But the focus on this project was Adobe Lightroom, partically the classic version to be excat, since it have more of the "legacy" features</p>

       <h3>Editing Experiance</h3>
       <p>Ever since I was introduced to lightroom from my old school (SyddanskErhversskole), I've had quite some fun, playing around with photo editing<p>
       <p>I was amazed by how easy it was to handle. It's basically just some sliders you got to play around with</p>
       <p>Unfortunally, after I changed school I haven't had the oppertunity to play with it for a while, since I lacked the expenses for the Adobe program</p>
       <p>But since enrolling at UCL, I have the enjoyment of playing around with it again. To a point where my experiances are getting better and better</p>
